# WaveNet for Chrome


## How to use
Although WaveNet for Chrome is a free extension, Google's text-to-speech [services are not](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/pricing). You will therefore need to [create your own API key through Google's Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/) and past it into the extension's popup menu.
