# WaveNet for Chrome
A wrapper for Google WaveNetâ€™s text-to-speech.

## How to use
Although WaveNet for Chrome is a free extension, Google's text-to-speech [services are not](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/pricing). You will therefore need to [create your own API key through Google's Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/) and past it into the extension's popup menu.

You will then be able to use the extension trough the context menu.

## Features
